# Classify the sentiment of sentences from the Rotten Tomatoes dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews

The Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset is a corpus of movie reviews used for sentiment analysis, originally collected by Pang and Lee [1]. In their work on sentiment treebanks, Socher et al. [2] used Amazon's Mechanical Turk to create fine-grained labels for all parsed phrases in the corpus. This competition presents a chance to benchmark your sentiment-analysis ideas on the Rotten Tomatoes dataset. You are asked to label phrases on a scale of five values: negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, positive. Obstacles like sentence negation, sarcasm, terseness, language ambiguity, and many others make this task very challenging.
